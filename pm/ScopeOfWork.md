# Scope of Work

## Project Description

A motorized toy snail car, no larger than 7"x7"x7", which shall be controllable via a remote via PPM protocol. The car shall be designed for indoor purposes, and be operable within a 30 foot radiius of the controller. The car shall also have a mechanical system which dispenses a fluid from it's tail onto the floor when a switch is turned on, mimicking a snail trail. This project will involve CAD modeling, mechanical and electrical design, PCB design, embedded programming, and 3D printing.

- Shall be hidden away from user access

## Constraints

## Deliverables

## Future Work

In the future, I'd like to have the car autonomously drive and be able to draw pictures on the floor using it's snail trail.
