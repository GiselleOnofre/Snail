# Scope of Work

## Project Description

A motorized toy snail car, no larger than 7"x7"x7", which shall be controllable via a remote via PPM protocol. The car shall be designed for indoor purposes, and be operable within a 30 foot radiius of the controller. The car shall also have a mechanical system which dispenses a fluid from it's tail onto the floor when a switch is turned on, mimicking a snail trail. This project will involve CAD modeling, mechanical and electrical design, PCB design, embedded programming, and 3D printing.

## Work Breakdown Structure

## Requirements

### Dipensing system

- Thin height 1-5mm thick
- As wide as the tail

- Commonly found in house holds
- Safety, shall be non-toxic

### Drive system

- Max speed 2MPH

#### Motors

-

#### Wheels

- Shall be suitable for hardwood, laminate, vinyl, with consideration for carpet flooring.
- Shall be hidden from outside view as much as possible
- Shall not slip out of fluid

#### Reciever

- Shall be able to recieve a XXX W signal from 30ft away.
- Shall be suitable for PPM protocol.

### Chasis

#### Shell

- Shall look like a snail shell, but funky

#### Head

- Resemble a snail head, w/ antennae

#### Tail

- Resemble a snail tail
- Shall drag on the ground

#### Bottom Plate

## Deliverables

## Future Work

In the future, I'd like to have the car autonomously drive and be able to draw pictures on the floor using it's snail trail.
